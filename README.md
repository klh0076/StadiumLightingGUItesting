Can select by: Row, Col, individual, all.
Trying to figure out how to click and drag select.
can add diagonal or other features pretty easy.

has ability to output a reference to a gameObject[], image[] ...
and also has a reference to a int[] with values representing a color of a light.

Can add a way to output an array of RBG objects.
